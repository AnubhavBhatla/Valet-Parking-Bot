-> Exactly one of the red, yellow, and green lights should be true in a clock cycle for both the main and side roads
-> Both maingreen and sidegreen should never be on in the same cycle
-> a green light should be followed by a yellow light for both the main and side roads. similarly, a red light should be followed by a yellow light for both the main and side roads
-> as long as carwait is true, sidegreen will eventually be true. similarly, as long as carwait is false, maingreen will eventually be true
